mini project 1 - car configuration models

An example model of Honda Accord 2016 is built based on a CAR language.

The CAR language is constructed for general audiences who are not expert in designing a car. 

The example model can be used for introducing the all parts in a car in a high-level abstraction way. 
Audiences can get general information about the car such as what is options supported in the current car, 
colour, producer, price, guarantee. They also can get some brief knowledge about how different components in the car connect with each other and what is the type of connection being used.
 
This model is also useful in the case that customers want to change some part in their car due that is damage in a car accident or simply renew their car a little bit.
